# Bubble_Sort

Welcome to Bubble_Sort!

Type 'print to [your filename here]' to print a list of random numbers to a file.

Type 'sort [your filename here] and store in [your other filename here]' to sort a list of numbers from a file and
put the sorted numbers into another file.

Type 'exit' to exit.

Please note that your filename cannot have spaces. You can use underscores as an alternative.

Please make sure to give file extensions in your file names or else it won't work properly.
So for example, adding a '.txt' at the end of your file name.
